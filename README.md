# SMS Alert Application  

## Overview  
The **SMS Alert Application** is an Android app that provides **real-time voice alerts**. It utilizes SMS interception to process incoming messages, decode their content, and trigger voice notifications via Text-to-Speech (TTS). The app is lightweight and runs seamlessly in the background.  

---

## Features  
- **Real-time Alerts**: Provides instant voice notifications for specific SMS messages.    
- **Voice Alerts**: Repeats the message alert exactly three times for clarity.  
- **Lightweight**: Runs efficiently in the background with minimal resource usage.  
- **Localized Support**: Configured for English-language alerts via TTS.  

---

## Project Architecture  
1. **Manifest File**  
   - Declares required permissions (e.g., RECEIVE_SMS, READ_SMS).  
   - Registers the Broadcast Receiver to listen for SMS messages.  

2. **Broadcast Receiver (`SmsReceiver`)**  
   - Intercepts SMS messages using the `SMS_RECEIVED` intent.  
   - Decodes messages from Protocol Data Unit (PDU) format.  
   - Filters messages by keywords and triggers Text-to-Speech alerts.  

3. **Main Activity**  
   - Serves as the entry point for initializing app components like the Broadcast Receiver and TTS engine.  

---

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Framework**: Android SDK  
- **API**: Android Telephony API for SMS processing and Text-to-Speech API  

---

## Permissions Used  
- **RECEIVE_SMS**: To listen for incoming SMS messages.  
- **READ_SMS**: To decode and access SMS message content.  

---

## Workflow  
1. **Incoming SMS**  
   - The app intercepts SMS messages broadcasted by the system.  

2. **Decoding & Filtering**  
   - Converts PDU data into human-readable content using `SmsMessage.createFromPdu()`.  

3. **Text-to-Speech Alert**  
   - Processes the filtered message content.  
   - Plays a voice alert for the received message exactly three times.
